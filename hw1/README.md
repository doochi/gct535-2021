# Homework #1: Sinusoid, Sampling, DFT and STFT (Due Mar 28)

### Instruction
The problem sets include short answers and Python programming. Organize your answers, figures and supporting comments using a word editor convenient for you (e.g., MS Word, Latex). You should use the Jupyter notebook for Python programming. You can set up the Jupyter notebook environment following the instruction at [this link](https://github.com/juhannam/gct535-2021/tree/main/practice). 

### Deliverable 
You should submit two items: the report and .ipynb file. Please compress them as a single file (e.g. zip) and submit it via KLMS.

## Problem #1: Sinusoids and Sampling (20 pts.)
You are given a continuous-time signal x(t)=sin(8000\*pi\*t)+sin(14000\*pi\*t)+sin(16000\*pi\*t)


1. What are the frequencies of the three sinusoids? (5pts.)


2. You sampled x(t) with a sampling rate 10000 Hz. Then, what are the resulting frequencies of the sinusoids in the discrete-time domain? (10pts.)
 

3. What is the minimum sampling rate to avoid aliasing ? (5pts.)


## Problem #2: Discrete Fourier Transform (20 pts.)

First, generate a sinusoidal waveform with 440Hz frequency and 8kHz sampling rate (1 second long). Verify the result by plotting the waveform and playing it back. 

1. Segment the sinusoid with a 20ms-long rectangular window (size 160 samples) and perform DFT (size 256 samples) on the segment with zero-padding.  Plot the magnitude response in dB and phase response (5pts.) 

2. Repeat 1 with Hann window. Discuss the difference in the magnitude response. (5 pts.)

3. Repeat 2 with zero-padding such that FFT size becomes 1024. Discuss the difference in the magnitude response. (10 pts.)


## Problem #3: Short-time Fourier Transform (50 pts.)

1. Implement a short-time Fourier transform function as follows (20pts.):

```
def stft(x, window, hop_size, fft_size):
 
# x: input samples (1-D vector)
# window: a window vector (e.g. window = hann(1024) where 1024 is the window size )
# hop_size: must be less than window size
# y: 2-D STFT matrix (complex numbers)

    ### Your Implementation of STFT ###


    return y
```

2. Load the provided glockenspiel WAV file and plot the spectrogram using your STFT function. Plot the spectrogram with two different window sizes such that one has high-time resolution and the other high frequency resolution. Describe what you observe (10 pts.)


3. Record your voice using Audacity (about 2-3 sec) and store it as a .wav file. Repeat b), particularly paying attention to vowel sounds.  (10 pts.)


4. Choose a music audio file (less than 10 seconds) and plot the spectrogram. Again, adjust the STFT parameters and see how they change the spectrogram. Compare your visual observation to what you hear in terms of musical element such as melodic or rhythm patterns. (10 pts.)
